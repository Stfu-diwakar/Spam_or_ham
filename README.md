# 📧 !-SPAM — Spam Email Classifier

A modern Machine Learning web app that detects whether a message is **Spam 🚫** or **Not Spam 📩** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 🌐 Live Demo

🔗 **Website:** *https://spamorham-d.streamlit.app/*

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📩 Detect spam emails/messages instantly
* 🧠 Built using Machine Learning (Naive Bayes + TF-IDF)
* 📊 Shows prediction confidence score
* 🎨 Clean and modern UI (Streamlit + custom styling)
* 🖼️ Custom logo and branding
* ⚡ Fast and lightweight

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Text input is converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
2. A trained **Naive Bayes model** predicts whether the message is spam
3. The app displays:

   * Prediction (Spam / Not Spam)
   * Confidence score
